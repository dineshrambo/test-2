The Mashup web appplication is designed where the user has to register and login using his google account. We implemented oAuth2.1 Login & registration. After the user login, the home page will be displayed. In the home page, we have three API's. FourSquare search API is used to get the nearby place upon our interest. AlchemyAPI using IBMBluemix account will give the sentimental analysis or review of the selected location. Google knowledge graph search API will give all the resultant names for searched word. User can logout after using the application which navigates to the login page. The screenshots of the operation of the application are shown in the Wiki page.
